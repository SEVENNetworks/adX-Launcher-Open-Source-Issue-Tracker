# adX Launcher

The goal of adX Launcher is to allow you to take advantage of our app enhancements, like ad and tracker blocking, directly from your device's home screen without requiring you to launch a separate app or root your device.

## How to use?

adX Launcher is currently in an open beta available in Google Play:
